I have created this website using HTML, CSS and Javascript and bootsrtrap as a part of pre-internship task at DIGIphantom. I have used different bootstrap components like cards, column, forms, etc. Also I have used various CSS styling features and some of the basic functionalities of Javascript. The website is Desktop-ready and I would soon make it mobile and other devices responsive as well.
